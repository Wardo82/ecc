# Coding for distributed storage.

## Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs)

- Goal: Reduce locality (r <= k)
- Effect: Increases the minimum distance
- Constructions: Tamo-Barg codes with small field size

## Regenerating Codes (RCs)

- Goal: Reduce repair bandwidth
- Effect: tradeoff between storage repair bandwidth
- Constructions: MBR and MSR codes with small field size

## TODOs and research areas:

- Maximally recoverable LRC codes
- Difference between functional and exact repair regenerating codes
- Efficient repair of RS codes
- Malicious adversaries in regenerating codes
